# MakeSTM
An admittedly hacked together program that creates STM files for Sonic the Hedgehog CD (1993) for the Sega CD. Currently only supports the opening FMV format. Support for the ending and pencil test FMVs will come later.

Honestly, this could be done a lot better, but I just wanted to get something out there. Maybe one day, I'll make something better, or maybe someone will come along and make something better. This works for now, I guess.
